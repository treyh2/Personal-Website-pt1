      <p>
        I am from New Braunfels, Tx. about 30 minutes north of San Antonio. I graduated from Canyon High School but originally went to Navarro High School. I played varsity basketball starting my freshman year and helped lead my team to back to back district championships my Junior and Senior year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of studying and playing basketball, I worked at a restaurant called Gruene River Grill. A restaurant on the Guadalupe River, that has live music, and a vibrant country atmosphere. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating, I decided to move to Dallas to pursue a degree in Software Engineering. I have been able to learn C, Java, and C++. I love to continue exploring the city, while also enjoying some of the hobbies I brought from home, like golf and basketball.
